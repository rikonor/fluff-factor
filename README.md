# [The Fluff Factor]

The fluff factor is a simple website where you can get a "fluff score" of text.  
A fluff score is based on the amount of fluff words present in the text.

#### What is a fluff word?

The interpreation of what is a fluff word is left to the users of the website.  
My opinion is that fluff words, in general, lack real substance.  
___In any case, any word shown on the screen can be voted on.___
